A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.

We use the Embedded System Network Security Dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled network traffic with features like packet size, inter-arrival time, and TCP/UDP flags. We utilize features representing protocol types (i.e., `protocol_type_TCP`, `protocol_type_UDP`), specific IP addresses (i.e., `src_ip_192.168.1.2`), and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) flags (`tcp_flags_FIN`, `tcp_flags_SYN`, `tcp_flags_SYN-ACK`). The label field indicates normal or anomalous observations which allows us to use supervised learning approaches. 

We chose this dataset because it provides a rich and realistic representation of network traffic data. The presence of labeled data allows us to train and evaluate supervised models; the diversity and volume of traffic patterns make it well-suited for exploring unsupervised anomaly detection techniques as well. This balance between complexity and feature richness aligns well with our research questions and modeling goals.

```{python}
#| label: preview-data-columns
cols = network_traffic.columns
for col in cols:
  print(col)
```

Make sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.

## Questions

Q1. Using supervised machine learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs), can we accurately calssify network traffic as normal and anomalous based on labeled data? How do their performances compare in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score?

Q2. Can unsupervised learning methods such as K-Means Clustering and Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN) detect anomalous patterns in network traffic without using labeled data? Regarding anomaly detection effectiveness, how do unsupervised compare to supervised approaches (LSTM and SVM) using external ground-truth labels for evaluation?
